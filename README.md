# Deck Shuffler

Quick exercise in shuffling a standard 52-card deck in Java. Resorting to good old Fisher-Yates.

Might be superfluous, but Gradle is used for building and dependency management.

Build the application (incl. tests) with:

    $ ./gradlew clean build

Run the application with:

    $ ./gradlew run
